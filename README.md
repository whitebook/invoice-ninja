# Invoice Ninja
## Simple, Intuitive Invoicing

### [https://www.invoiceninja.com](https://www.invoiceninja.com)
### Introduction

Most online invoicing sites are expensive. They shouldn't be. The aim of this project is to provide a free, open-source alternative. Additionally, the hope is the codebase will serve as a sample site for Laravel as well as other JavaScript technologies.

[This guide](http://hillelcoren.com/invoice-ninja/self-hosting/) is the simplest way to setup the site. The high level instructions for setting up the site using Git are below but there's also a more detailed [setup guide](http://hillelcoren.com/invoice-ninja/laravel-ubuntu-virtualbox/). To deploy the app with [Docker](http://www.docker.com/) you can use [this project](https://github.com/rollbrettler/Dockerfiles/tree/master/invoice-ninja).

To connect follow [@invoiceninja](https://twitter.com/invoiceninja) or join the [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/invoiceninja). For discussion of the code please use the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/invoiceninja).

If you'd like to translate the site please use [caouecs/Laravel4-long](https://github.com/caouecs/Laravel4-lang) for the starter files.

    cd ninja

Install Laravel packages using Composer

Note: you may be prompted for your Github user/pass due to their API limits. 

    composer install

Install JavaScript and HTML packages using Bower

    bower install

Create the development environment configurations

    mkdir app/config/development
    cp app/config/app.php app/config/development/
    cp app/config/database.php app/config/development/
    cp app/config/mail.php app/config/development/

Create database user and a database for ninja

    CREATE SCHEMA `ninja` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
    CREATE USER 'ninja'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'ninja';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `ninja`.* TO 'ninja'@'localhost';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Configure development/config/database.php and development/config/mail.php and initialize the database.
